# Cardiovascular-Windkessel-Modeling-Using-Computation-and-Non-Invasive-Imaging

# Action: Formulated an advanced MATLAB-based cardiovascular windkessel model, integrating non-invasive imaging data (e.g., ultrasound) for comprehensive blood flow and arterial stiffness analysis. 
# Problem: Predicting and modeling diverse physiological cardiovascular characteristics through computational simulations. 
# Solution: Synthesized imaging biomarkers to develop a robust two-element windkessel model, accurately predicting hemodynamic parameters and their relationship to physiological variables. 
# Result: Validated model predictions showcase significant correlations between arterial compliance and blood pressure. This model's potential applications include personalizing treatment plans for cardiovascular patients and potentially reducing reliance on invasive procedures in clinical cardiovascular assessments.
